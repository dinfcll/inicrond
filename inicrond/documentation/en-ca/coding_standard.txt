php specific stuff

    The language keywords in lowercase.
    Use $array[] = $var instead of $array []= $var because it's more readable.
    Concatenate string and avoid using dynamic variable interpolation, i.e. :
    use 'hello '.$you instead of "hello $you".
    Use 'array_key' instead of "array_key", i.e. single quotes.

Coding standard

    The coding standard is the GNU coding standard (I know that some portion of the code is not conform to it..)

    The code is indented with 4 spaces.
    When a logic expression cannot fit on one line, split it before a logic binary operator.

        if ($foo
        && $bar)

        instead of

        if ($foo &&
        $bar)

    Put a space before an opening parenthesis for if (), while (), elseif (), etc ...

    The kate editor can remove trailing spaces on save time!!

    Put a space before a semi-colon

        $i ++ ; instead of $i ++;

    Use the variable name $query to hold a sql query.

    The function name in its definition must start in column 0.
