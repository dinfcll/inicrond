    Use utf8_general_ci collation for MySQL.
    everything is in utf-8.

Before january 2, 2006

    All the source code is encoded in utf8. (I can put some accents in the comments ;P)

    All the languages file are encoded in ISO-8859-1 because php does not yet support utf8.

    My MySQL Collation is utf8_general_ci.

    I use the default_charset (iso-8859-15) in my php.ini.

    I *think* that fwrite save as iso-8859-1, but I am not sure at all.
